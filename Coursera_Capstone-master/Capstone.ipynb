We have the data about demographic information of each city. We have data about the places like - Restaurants, college, Neighboor hood , shopping places etc. We will use this data to visualize the patterns and make a predictive model for users who are planning to move in this are and users who are planning to open business like restraunt in this area."

I am also going to count how many shopping places are in each cluster or Borough. The distance that I'll will caculate using lat and longitutdes will help new businessmans to find best location for their business. The number of shopping places and schools in an area will tell me about its populaty , so new user who have kids will want to move near to the school area. To check the similarities and disimilarities I'll also try to incorporate economic data, to see how all these places running in each cities are generating revenues or not "
